    <h1>Naruto</h1>
    <p>This list wouldn't be complete without one of my bests mangas of all time. Who hasn't heard of Naruto? Right???? Naruto literally changed the way I think of life and all the misfortunes that has ever occurred in my lifetime. I spent my childhood watching Naruto on CartoonNetwork. Sadly, the series stopped airing after a few years and this left me dumbfounded, until i discovered the world of online Manga. Naruto stayed with me throughout my highschool and college years. It was a memorable ride. </p>
    <p>Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. </p>
