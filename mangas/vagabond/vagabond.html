    <h1>Vagabond</h1>
    <p>This is the first manga that comes to my mind when i say/hear Manga.</p>
    <p>This is, according to me Mr. Inoue Takehiko's finest work out there.(Every manga he has ever published is an absolute work of art.). No disrespect to any of his alternate works. Vagabond is my top choice.</p>
    <p>Vagabond (Japanese: バガボンド, Hepburn: Bagabondo) is a Japanese epic martial arts manga series written and illustrated by Takehiko Inoue. It portrays a fictionalized account of the life of Japanese swordsman Musashi Miyamoto, based on Eiji Yoshikawa's novel Musashi. It has been serialized in Kodansha's seinen manga magazine Morning since September 1998.</p>
    <p>Given below are some of the finest manga panels of this series.(Not only this series but the manga industry overall):</p>
